# Hanabi Competiton Conventions

### Positional Discard/Misplay Adjustments
* Near the end of the game in a cycling situation, we are trying to find the remaining playables in the deck and play them all as quickly as possible. We want to handle tricky situations at least as well as other teams, and the normal positional discard/misplay rules do not seem sufficient.
* One tricky situation is when a player has no playable cards in hand, but is at 8 clues (and thus may not discard)
* Another tricky situation is when the team has two strikes, a player has no playable cards in hand, and would like to indicate that both their teammates or only one of their teammates has a playable card in slot 1.
* The solution to these tricky situations is the following adjustments:
  * Discarding chop (or bombing chop at 8 clues) is always just cycling
  * When we are in a clear stalling situation and everyone is quite sure that no player has playables on slot 2 or older:
    * Bombing slot 1 (and/or discarding slot 1 at two strikes) indicates that both teammates have playables on slot 1.
    * Bombing slot 2 (and/or discarding slot 2 at two strikes) indicates that only one teammate has a playable on slot 1.

### Declined OCM Single Card Save
* If Alice clues Bob's chop directly touching **one** card instead of OCMing it, Bob should chop move the card next to the saved card
